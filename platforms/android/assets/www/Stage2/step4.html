The weather has taken an unexpected turn for the better and that is making this final part of completing his degree that bit harder! So Raj spends most days going out, and playing football. By the time he gets back he decides it's too late to be able to concentrate on studying so watches movies and plays Halo on the Xbox. He vows to start work the next day. But then the next day...
